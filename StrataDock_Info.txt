  STRATADOCK — AI-Powered Drug Discovery Suite
==================================================

What is StrataDock?
-------------------
StrataDock is a software tool I built for molecular
docking — the computational process of predicting how
a drug molecule physically binds to a target protein.

Instead of writing complex command-line scripts,
StrataDock wraps everything into a clean, interactive
web application that runs on your local machine.

It's designed to automate an entire drug screening
pipeline: from uploading raw protein & drug files,
to generating 3D molecular structures, running
AI-guided docking simulations, and producing a
results table with ranked hits and downloadable reports.


What problem does it solve?
---------------------------
Traditional molecular docking pipelines require
separate software tools, manual command-line steps,
complex file format conversions, and a lot of
computational chemistry expertise.

StrataDock automates the entire chain end-to-end,
making it accessible to researchers and students who
want results without spending days configuring software.


Key Technologies Used
---------------------
- GNINA: The primary docking engine. It uses a
  Convolutional Neural Network (similar to the kind
  used in image recognition) trained on thousands of
  real protein-drug crystal structures from the Protein
  Data Bank (PDB). It scores how well a drug fits
  a protein pocket like a trained expert.

- AutoDock Vina: The industry-standard physics-based
  docking engine. Used as a fast, reliable fallback.

- RDKit: Cheminformatics library. Converts 1D chemical
  text strings (SMILES) into full 3D molecular models
  with correct geometry and bonds.

- fpocket: Automatically analyzes a protein's surface
  and identifies the top 5 most likely drug-binding
  cavities on the protein's surface.

- OpenBabel: Adjusts the proton count on drug molecules
  to match physiological conditions (pH 7.4) before
  docking, for more biologically accurate results.


What it can do
--------------
- Upload protein files (.pdb) and drug files (.smi)
- Automatically generate 3D structures for drugs
- Detect the top 5 binding pockets on a protein
- Dock every drug against every protein & pocket
  simultaneously using parallelized multi-threading
- Use a deep learning AI (GNINA) to score and rank
  the best binding poses
- Run flexible docking where the protein's amino acid
  side chains actually move to accommodate the drug
  (simulating "induced fit" biology)
- Display results in a color-coded table:
    Green = Strong binding (very negative Vina score)
    Red   = Weak binding (less negative Vina score)
- Calculate drug-likeness (ADMET) statistics using
  RDKit: Lipinski's Rule of Five, LogP, QED score
- View the actual 3D binding pose in the browser
- Export a full ZIP archive containing all scores,
  a PDF report, the raw output files, and a PyMOL
  visualization script
- Save and reload the entire session state so you
  never have to re-run calculations from scratch


How to interpret the scores
---------------------------
Vina Score (kcal/mol):
  The estimated binding free energy.
  More negative = stronger binding = better candidate.
  Typically: below -8 is considered good.
              below -10 is excellent.

CNN Pose Probability (0-1):
  AI confidence score. How sure the neural network is
  that the predicted binding pose looks like a real
  biological interaction from actual crystal data.
  Higher = more trustworthy pose.

CNN Affinity (pKd):
  AI-predicted potency.
  pKd of 9 = nanomolar affinity = very potent drug.
  pKd = -log10(dissociation constant Kd)

QED Score (0-1):
  Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness.
  A composite score combining 8 drug-likeness
  properties. Above 0.7 is considered excellent.


How to run it (technical)
--------------------------
1. Works on Linux or Windows (via WSL2)
2. Run: bash setup.sh   (installs everything once)
3. Run: ./run.sh        (launches the app)
4. Open browser at: http://localhost:8501
